	<p>#OurBucketList<p><br> 
	<p>"Many people die with their music still in them. Why is this so? Too often it is because they are always getting ready to live. Before they know it, time runs out." — Oliver Wendell Holmes</p><br>
	<p>Everyone loves a Bucket List, but how often do people complete everything on that allusive list? This project aims to recontextualise the private and personal nature of a Bucket List, whilst also seeking to motivate people to live out their Bucket List dreams.</p><br>
	<p>So, what is a Bucket List? A Bucket List is a collection of places/experiences a person would like to visit/participate in in their life time. The resulting list is personal and reflective of that persons taste, location, occupation and socioeconomic status, making every Bucket List unique to it’s owner. But, what would happen if you created a communal Bucket List? A Bucket List, that immediately contrasts its very definition.</p><br>
	<p>By creating a Twitter account, this project does exactly that. It takes tweet’s from Twitter accounts with relatively small followings (relatively private) and publicises them (to a degree) to a singular feed of Bucket List items.</p><br>
	<p>#OurBucketList also plays on the seemingly never-ending cycle of a Bucket List… How often do people actually complete every single item on their Bucket List? By using inspirational quotes, this project seeks to “inspire” people to go out and achieve their Bucket List goals, no matter how trivial. </p>
